Bookstore Management System (SQL Project)
This project demonstrates a relational database design and a series of SQL queries to manage a bookstore's operations — including books inventory, customer records, and order transactions. The SQL script handles data creation, insertion, and insightful analytical queries.

🗃️ Database Schema
The project includes three main relational tables:

BOOKS: Stores information about books, including title, author, genre, price, stock, and publication year.

CUSTOMER: Contains customer details such as name, email, phone, city, and country.

ORDERS: Maintains order records linking customers and books, along with order date, quantity, and total cost.

🧱 SQL Operations Covered
🔧 Table Creation
Designed normalized tables with PRIMARY KEY constraints and FOREIGN KEY relationships.

📌 CRUD and Query Operations
Data Retrieval using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Conditional Filtering with WHERE, BETWEEN, HAVING

Aggregate Functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), DISTINCT()

📊 Key Query Highlights
Retrieve books by genre or publication year.

Identify customers from a specific country (e.g., Canada).

Find total stock available or the most expensive book.

Calculate total revenue generated.

Get the most frequently ordered book.
